# GT Motorcycle Parking Map

This is a pretty simple Vite + ReactJS project which uses OpenLayers to render an OpenStreetMap basemap and display various colored circles around the Georgia Tech campus. These circles correspond to motorcycle parking spaces around campus, and their various states. This is important to the GT motorcycle community due to the current haphazard state of motorcycle parking.

It is hosted here: https://dan7210.github.io/GTMotoMap/
